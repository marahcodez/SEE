Fun Calculator 🎉
A simple and fun Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. It adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides—all with a sprinkle of emoji magic! 😎

Features ✨
➕ Addition – Adds two numbers

➖ Subtraction – Subtracts the second number from the first

✖️ Multiplication – Multiplies the two numbers

➗ Division – Divides the first number by the second (watch out for division by zero!)

How to Use 🚀
Run the script in a Python environment:

sh
python fun_calculator.py
Enter the first number when prompted.

Enter the second number when prompted.

See the results of all four operations displayed in a fun and readable way!

Example Output
text
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 2  

Results of your two numbers:  
Sum: 12.0  
Difference: 8.0  
Product: 20.0  
Quotient: 5.0  
Requirements
Python 3.x

Limitations ⚠️
❗ No error handling for division by zero (yet!) – If you divide by zero, Python will crash.

❗ Only works with two numbers – No support for more inputs (but feel free to expand it!).

Future Improvements 🔧
🛡️ Add error handling for invalid inputs (like text instead of numbers).

🧮 Extend functionality to support more than two numbers.

🔄 Allow repeated calculations without restarting the program.
